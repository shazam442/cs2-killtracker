# README

This repo contains a Ruby on Rails webserver that is able to receive game data from Counter Strike 2 players in realtime and provides API endpoints for accessing said game data (kills, deaths, etc.).

My related project ESP32-CS2-Killtracker contains the code for a microprocessor with a display to fetch and display killcounts for any given player via HTTP Polling.
